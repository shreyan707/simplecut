//! SimpleCut's window: media library on the left, preview in the middle, timeline at the bottom,
//! essential controls in the toolbar. Everything the user can do is an [`Action`]; the panels only
//! draw and queue actions, and [`SimpleCutApp::perform`] is the one place they are carried out, so
//! tests and the buttons share a path.
